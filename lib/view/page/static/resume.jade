          h4 I'm a veteran

        p I'm a technology lifer who combines deep development chops with product vision and leadership experience.

        p As a software craftsman, I've mastered the entire stack, from web UI to backend infrastructure and cloud deployment.

        p As a technology leader, I've built many new products from the ground up. But I specialize in transforming messy startup code into a solid foundation for future growth.

        p As a team player, I've mentored a long parade of junior developers and worked alongside countless product leads, designers, business analysts and QA engineers.

          h4 I'm a generalist

        p I build web and mobile applications using git, bash, Node, Mongo, Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS 3, nginx and many other languages, platforms and frameworks.

        p Grocery lists are exhausting, but I'd love to chat with you about my favorite technologies in depth.

          dd I favor coding, mentoring and collaborating over pure management roles.
          dt Product-focused
          dd I can build your app, but I also want to help define your vision.
          dt Nimble
          dd I know how to translate a market opportunity into an MVP and iterate.
          dt Collaborative
          dd I'm at my best working on a small, cross-functional team.
